    "**ACID stands for:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Atomicity:** Ensures that a transaction is completed fully or not executed at all. If any part fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.  \n",
    "- **Consistency:** Guarantees that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another, maintaining data integrity.  \n",
    "- **Isolation:** Ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other, preventing data inconsistencies.  \n",
    "- **Durability:** Once a transaction is committed, the changes are permanently stored, even in the event of a system failure.  \n",

    "SQL injection attacks occur when malicious input is used to manipulate database queries. Preventing them is essential for maintaining database security.\n",

    "**Common Prevention Techniques:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Prepared Statements / Parameterized Queries:** Ensures user input is treated as data, not executable code.  \n",
    "- **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize user inputs before processing.  \n",
    "- **Use Stored Procedures:** Restrict direct query execution when properly implemented.  \n",
    "- **Limit Database Permissions:** Grant only necessary privileges to database users.  \n",
    "- **Avoid Dynamic SQL:** Reduce or carefully handle dynamically constructed queries.  \n",
