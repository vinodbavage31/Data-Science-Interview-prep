    "## 31. How does a FOREIGN KEY constraint ensure data integrity between tables?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **FOREIGN KEY** is a constraint that establishes a relationship between two tables by linking a column in one table to the **PRIMARY KEY** of another. It ensures that the referenced value exists, maintaining referential integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Ensures Data Integrity:**\n",
    "- Prevents insertion of values that do not exist in the referenced table  \n",
    "- Avoids orphan records by enforcing valid relationships  \n",
    "- Controls updates and deletions through rules such as CASCADE, SET NULL, or RESTRICT  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE departments (\n",
    "    dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    dept_name VARCHAR(50)\n",
